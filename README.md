The following repository consists of homework solutions for the course MIT 18.S191: Introduction to Computational Thinking. Homework files are stored in directories corresponding to the homework week. Original, incomplete assignments are named "hw" followed by the week (ex. hw0). It is recommended that completed assignments are saved along with initials or another unique identifier (ex. JohnSmithHomework0). Users can checkout files from the directories and compare answers, suggest changes, and collaborate.
